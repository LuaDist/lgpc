This is a library for Boolean operations on polygons for Lua 5.1. It is based
on gpc, written by Alan Murta and available at
	http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/aig/staff/alan/software/

To try this Lua library, first get gpc from the URL above. Open the zip file
and save gpc.c and gpc.h in this diretory. (gpc consists of a single module,
but I haven't included it here because it is copyrighted software, free only
for non-commercial use.)

Then edit Makefile to reflect your installation of Lua and run make. This
will build the library and run a simple test. For detailed installation
instructions, see
	http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~lhf/ftp/lua/install.html

There is no manual but the library is simple and intuitive; see the summary
below. Read also test.lua, which shows the library in action. Display or print
test.ps, which is output when you run "make test".

This code is hereby placed in the public domain.
Please send comments, suggestions, and bug reports to lhf@tecgraf.puc-rio.br .
