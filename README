This is a library for Boolean operations on polygons for Lua 5.1. It is based
on GPC, written by Alan Murta and available at
	http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/~toby/alan/software/

To try the library, first get GPC from the URL above. Open the zip file and
save gpc.c and gpc.h in this diretory. (GPC consists of a single module, but
I haven't included it here because it is copyrighted software, free only for
non-commercial use.) Edit Makefile to reflect your installation of Lua and
then run make. This will build the library and run a simple test.
For detailed installation instructions, see
	http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~lhf/ftp/lua/install.html

There is no manual but the library is simple and intuitive; see the summary
below. Read also test.lua, which shows the library in action. Display or print
test.ps, which is output when you run "make test".

This code is hereby placed in the public domain. GPC has its own license.
Please send comments, suggestions, and bug reports to lhf@tecgraf.puc-rio.br .
